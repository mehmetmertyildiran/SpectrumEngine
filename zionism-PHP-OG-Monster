The ELM paradigm is a fast and accurate learning alternative for single layer Feedforward networks. We experiment on the acted facial expressions in the wild corpus, which features seven discrete emotions, and adhere to the EmotiW 2014 challenge protocols. In our study, better results for both modalities are obtained with kernel ELM compared to basic ELM. We contrast several fusion approaches and reach a test set accuracy of 50.12 % (over a video-only baseline of 33.70 %) on the seven-class (i.e. six basic emotions plus neutral) EmotiW 2014 Challenge, by combining one audio and three video sub-systems. We also compare ELM with partial least squares regression based classification that is used in the top performing system of EmotiW 2014, and discuss the advantages of both approaches."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220656409_Geometric_Means_in_a_Novel_Vector_Space_Structure_on_Sysmetric_Positive-Definite_Matrices", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23631413_Multivariate_Normal_Distributions_Parametrized_as_a_Riemannian_Symmetric_Space", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7641976_Feature_Selection_Based_On_Mutual_Information_Criteria_of_Max-DependencyMax-Relevance_and_Min-Redundancy", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266654707_Partial_least_squares_regression_on_Grassmannian_manifold_for_emotion_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224929655_openSMILE_--_The_Munich_Versatile_and_Fast_Open-Source_Audio_Feature_Extractor", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220578095_Least_Squares_Support_Vector_Machine_Classifiers", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8204636_Canonical_Correlation_Analysis_An_Overview_with_Application_to_Learning_Methods", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261206959_Local_Gabor_Binary_Patterns_from_Three_Orthogonal_Planes_for_Automatic_Facial_Expression_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3193420_Multiresolution_Gray-Scale_and_Rotation_Invariant_Texture_Classification_with_Local_Binary_Patterns", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221491017_A_database_of_German_emotional_speech", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259889921_The_INTERSPEECH_2013_computational_paralinguistics_challenge_Social_signals_conflict_emotion_autism", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232638637_Cross-Corpus_Acoustic_Emotion_Recognition_Variances_and_Strategies", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256575180_Collecting_Large_Richly_Annotated_Facial-Expression_Databases_from_Movies", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221481381_The_INTERSPEECH_2010_paralinguistic_challenge", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262313360_Emotion_Recognition_In_The_Wild_Challenge_2013", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24061088_Note_on_the_Sampling_Error_of_the_Difference_Between_Correlated_Proportions_or_Percentages", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221936069_Introduction_to_Machine_Learning", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269100829_CCA_based_feature_selection_with_application_to_continuous_depression_recognition_from_acoustic_speech_features", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346037_Grassman_Discriminant_Analysis_a_Unifying_View_on_Subspace-Based_learning", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269100662_Random_Discriminative_Projection_Based_Feature_Selection_with_Application_to_Conflict_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269100765_Canonical_Correlation_Analysis_and_Local_Fisher_Discriminant_Analysis_based_Multi-View_Acoustic_Feature_Reduction_for_Physical_Load_Prediction", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262165643_Combining_modality_specific_deep_neural_networks_for_emotion_recognition_in_video", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4238264_The_eNTERFACE05_Audio-Visual_Emotion_Database", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51704039_Extreme_learning_machine_for_regression_and_multiclass_classification_IEEE_Trans_Syst_Man_Cybern_422_513-529", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224929562_Voice_and_Speech_Analysis_in_Search_of_States_and_Traits", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261502521_Covariance_discriminative_learning_A_natural_and_efficient_approach_to_image_set_classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243780258_Line_Spectrum_Representation_of_Linear_Predictor_Coefficients_of_Speech_Signals", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222667300_Extreme_Learning_Machine_Theory_and_Applications", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267213794_Speech_Emotion_Recognition_Using_Deep_Neural_Network_and_Extreme_Learning_Machine", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269100725_Combining_Modality-Specific_Extreme_Learning_Machines_for_Emotion_Recognition_in_the_Wild", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200038910_Lowe_DG_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Key-points_Int_J_Comput_Vision_602_91-110", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4116697_Extreme_learning_machine_A_new_learning_scheme_of_feedforward_neural_networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259399116_Kernel_Learning_for_Extrinsic_Classification_of_Manifold_Features"]}

## Beyond the basics

Philosophy ahead

## "Extreme" machine learning

We have discussed two "extreme" algorithms: [Extremely Randomized Trees](RandomForests.md#extremely-randomized-trees), a variant on Random Forests, and [Extreme Learning Machines](NeuralNetworks.md#extreme-learning-machines), a variant on neural networks.  Despite having completely different algorithm designs, the "extreme" variants have a fundamental behavior in common: rather than trying to _optimize_ some internal parameter, they instead choose from _many random options_, and thus have _less intrinsic bias_ than their cousins.

The video baseline provides histograms of Local Gabor Binary Pat-terns from Three Orthogonal Planes (LGBP-TOP) features. Based on our preliminary experiments on AVEC 2013 chal-lenge data, we focus on the inner facial regions that corre-spond to eyes and mouth area. We obtain an ensemble of regional linear regressors via CCA and MPGI. We also enrich the 2014 baseline set with Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) features extracted using Intraface toolkit detected/tracked faces. Combining both representations in a CCA ensemble approach, on the challenge test set we reach an average Pear-son's Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.3932, outperform-ing the ASC test set baseline PCC of 0.1966. On the DSC, combining modality specific MPGI based ensemble systems, we reach 9.61 Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
